# Contributing to Mito

Hiya - it's great to meet you here!

When contributing to Mito, first make sure that the changes you wish to make are in-line with the project direction. If you're not sure, open an issue before starting work.

## Communication

If you're thinking of contributing to Mito, join our [discord](https://discord.gg/XdJSZyejJU) or [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/trymito/shared_invite/zt-1h6t163v7-xLPudO7pjQNKccXz7h7GSg).

## Issue Policy

We track issues so that we can fix them! As such, having organized and well-structured issues is really helpful in making Mito better. To help us accomplish this, please keep the following in mind:

- If you have an issue installing Mito, please make a post in the `#install-help` Discord channel rather than opening an issue, as it will allow us to help you more quickly.
- If you run into an issue with Mito that is specific to data you are using Mito with, **try and include a sample of the data in the issue**. For example, if Mito gives you an error while renaming a specific column in your dataset, upload enough of the dataframe that we can replicate this (make sure it's not private data!).


## Language Policy

On top of having a clean issue tracker, we like to keep the language in the rest of our codebase as well-kept as possible. To help us do this, keep the following in mind:
- The official project language is American English. 
- Do your best to use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation (Oxford commas optional).

We like to keep things professional, casual, and nice. And we never object to some sillyness :-}

## Code Submission Policy

Nobody is perfect when they are writing code, least of all us. That being said, here are some general dos and don'ts if you're submitting code to Mito

**Do:**
- Test your code before submitting it. Even the smallest changes can have unexpected consequences, so make sure you verify that the changes you make do what you want them to.
- Write good commit messages. We're not super picky here, but try and stick to the format "Area changed: change that was made". A good commit message looks like "Pivot: removed limitation where using a column in multiple sections caused errors". A bad commit message looks like "fix bug".
- Match the style of the surrounding code. We're working on a more helpful style guide currently!
- Make sure all tests are passing on your PR. We like to review PRs that have all tests passing :-)

**Don't:**
- Touch pieces of the code outside the scope of the PR.
- Include commented-out code.
- Refactor code just for the sake of refactoring it, without any beneficial changes.

## Pull Request Q&A

### I've submitted a PR and it passes CI. When can I expect to get some review feedback?

We aim to review all outstanding PRs within the week they are posted, and will do our best to get to them quicker if possible. If a week has passed without any feedback, consider posting in our Discord!
